# express-typescript-sequelize
This project is initial setup for express, sequelize, typescript and webpack.

# Caution

To use sequelize-typescript, which I would suggest, you need to checkout the "ts-sqlz" branch with "git checkout ts-sqlz"

To launch and test the server, got to "server" and "npm install".

Post installation use "npm start" to spin the server.

Note: The configuration to connect to postgres sql is wriiten in "server/config". Change that to suit your configuration.
